                    A-List protection was founded by
                    John Windsor, in 1936 in
                    the small town of
                    Buckeye, New York. When
                    crime rates were at an all time high, the essential need for protection was vital.
                    New Jersey was a hotspot for criminal activity, and higher ups such as politicians, businessmen, and
                    famous actors of that time needed that security in order to fully perform their daily activities and
                    routines.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The firm has undergone several changes throughout the
                    years, as society progressed and technology
                    improved. The changes included the change of the firm name, and when historical events occurred,
                    A-List Protection became an equal employment opportunity employer.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    By the time the 1990's were around, John Windsor hired his
                    daughter, who became the CEO and since
                    then, Eleanore Windsor has been maintaining its integrity and respect from many other agencies.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A-List Protection has been keeping its promise to clients
                    for secure protection with discreet
                    security. We hope we can provide that for you through our services.
